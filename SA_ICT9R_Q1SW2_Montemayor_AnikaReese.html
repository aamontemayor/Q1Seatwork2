			<td>
				<dl>
					<dd>A wealthy young man of mixed Spanish and Filipino ancestry who has recently returned to the Philippines from Europe after spending seven years studying abroad. Ibarra is cultured and well-respected, though the friars in his hometown of San Diego are suspicious of him. This is because his father Don Rafael was recently imprisoned and labeled a subversive and heretic, a sentence that eventually led to his death in jail. Ibarra learns of this on his first night back in the Philippines.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt><b>Appearance</b></dt>
					<dd>Crisostomo Ibarra is a healthy young man who wore mourning clothes in the party at Capitan Tiago's residence. In ordinary occasions, he would wear a cravat, coat, and vest. His face was that of a typical Spanish mestizo but with brown complexion with ruddy cheeks.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt><b>Personality & Traits</b></dt>
					<dd>Ibarra was an earnest and idealistic young man. Influenced by his European education, he sought to improve the country; as part of this, he believed in the power of education to enact reforms and made efforts to establish a school in San Diego to this end. As part of this idealism, Ibarra believed in the good of all people and was unaware of his enemies. Despite all this, Ibarra also believed that some forms of oppression were necessary for society to function, such as the abusive Guardia Civil.</dd>

			<td>
				<dl>
				<dd>A woman well-regarded in San Diego for her high social station. Having grown up together as childhood friends, María Clara and Ibarra are engaged to be married, though Father Dámaso—her godfather—is displeased with this arrangement and does what he can to interfere. When Ibarra is excommunicated after almost killing Dámaso at a dinner party, arrangements are made for María Clara to marry a young Spanish man named Linares. She doesn’t speak up against this idea because she doesn’t want to cross her father, Captain Tiago, a spineless socialite who disavows Ibarra to stay in the good graces of friars like Father Dámaso.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
				<dt><b>Appearance</b></dt>
				<dd>In the novels, María Clara is described as a devout Roman Catholic who became the epitome of virtue, "demure and self-effacing,” humorless and prone to fainting. Her traits were further described by Rizal as an "Oriental decoration" with "downcast" eyes and a "pure soul".</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
				<dt><b>Personality & Traits</b></dt>
				<dd>Maria Clara was a sweet and kindhearted young woman. Raised with affection, Maria Clara was well-loved by everyone around her, and could be moved into acts of charity as with the case of the leper. Despite this, Maria Clara was torn between her love for Ibarra and her love for her family, ultimately choosing to protect Capitan Tiago's reputation, although regretful of how her decision affected Ibarra. Following her fiancé's alleged death, Maria Clara became distraught, wishing to forget Ibarra and become a nun, even at one point desiring death.</dd>

					<dd>Ibarra’s father, who has died before the novel’s opening pages. Ibarra learns from a sympathetic friend of his father’s, Lieutenant Guevara, that Don Rafael perished in prison after Father Dámaso accused him of heresy and subversion. These accusations surfaced because Don Rafael refused to attend confession, thinking it useless and instead trying to live according to his own moral compass, which was, Lieutenant Guevara says, incredibly strong and respectable. Not long thereafter, Don Rafael came across a government tax collector beating a little boy. When he intervened, he accidentally killed the collector and was subsequently imprisoned.</dd>
